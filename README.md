VocalMimic2 is my custom-designed voice cloning pipeline, built on deep learning principles and optimized for real-world usability. Unlike reference implementations, VocalMimic2 integrates the full pipeline â€” encoder, synthesizer, and vocoder â€” into a user-friendly GUI, making voice cloning accessible even for non-technical users.

âœ¨ Key Highlights of VocalMimic2

Custom-Trained Models

Encoder: Learns unique voice features from short audio samples.

Synthesizer: Converts text into intermediate spectrograms in the target voice.

Vocoder: Transforms spectrograms into natural-sounding audio.

Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Simple interface to upload/record audio.

Type text and instantly generate cloned speech.

Eliminates the need for command-line execution.

Performance Improvements

Optimized training dataset for cleaner synthesis.

Faster inference with lightweight preprocessing.

Better handling of varied accents and speaker tones.

Extensibility

Modular design for swapping models.

Future-ready for multi-lingual voice cloning.

Can be deployed as a desktop or web-based application.

ðŸ§ª How It Works

Input: Provide a short voice sample (~5â€“10 seconds).

Encoding: The encoder extracts speaker embeddings.

Synthesis: Text is transformed into a spectrogram with the target voice characteristics.

Vocoding: Spectrogram is converted into a realistic waveform.

Output: Generated speech in the cloned voice.

ðŸš€ Why VocalMimic2?

While VocalMimic1 (RTVC reference pipeline) demonstrates the concept of real-time voice cloning, VocalMimic2 improves on it by:

Offering a plug-and-play GUI.

Using custom-trained models tuned on my dataset.

Supporting better integration for future applications like chatbots, dubbing, and accessibility tools.
